# Hcubedcoder.com Redesign
My redesigned website hcubedcoder.com

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and some vanilla javascript

The site uses Node.js on the back end and an AWS Lightsail instance.  In addition, the redesigned backend includes routing to handle Get Requests to an S3 bucket to deliver Sermons to the the client on demand.
